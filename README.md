Click the link below to play the Greatest word game.

[Mad Libs](https://www.madlibs.com) (a play on ad lib, from Latin ad libitum - as you wish) is a word game where one player prompts another for a list of words to substitute for blanks in a story; these word substitutions have a humorous effect when the resulting story is then read aloud. A phrasal  template word game created by Leonard Stern and Roger Price. This game is often played as pastime or at party.

## How do you play Mad Libs?

One player acts as the “reader” and asks the other players, who haven't seen the story, to fill in the blanks with adjectives, nouns, exclamations, colors, adjectives, and more. These words are inserted into the blanks and then the story is read aloud to hilarious results. There are no winners or losers, only laughter.

## Creating the Game in Python.

#### Dependencies 
    from tkinter import *

There are three functions defined for three mad libs stories. You can make a story and leave few spaces to be filled by another. Inputs like noun, pronoun, adjective, adverb can be taken from another player using input method. After the inputs are taken, we print the story along with the user-input words in places to make our story.

Once the story is done, you can ask the input from the user and run the program. The results will be very funny, and be careful, the user who attempts to input should not be aware of the story model, because where is the fun when the player already knows the story?
